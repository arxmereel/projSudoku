Possible ideas for teh objects needed and thier responsibilities:
Contributots: dillohills, arxmereel

Case one:
Val class for the input of numbers

Row/Col/Area classes using Polymorphism that inherit from a Section class where each object has 9 Val objects, sharing them between others
Board class which has 9 rows, 9 cols, 9 areas, and 81 Vals

Front end GUI class and an overall game manager class

Addendum:
Possibly use area class instead of 9 vals inside each area; each area replaced by a 3x3 array
Getters could easily get the sum and contents of each row/co, which could lead to more streamlined process.

Possible downsides- could cause issues when generating fully working sudoku puzzle.

May need polymorphism to expand the final "board" class to allow for "guesses" during gameplay.
